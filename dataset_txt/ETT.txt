[Rules]
1. WHEN high voltage load (HUFL/HULL) exceeds threshold for >4h THEN oil temperature (OT) likely rises within 6h
2. Sudden changes in medium/low voltage loads (MUFL/LUFL) may indicate temperature fluctuations within 2-4h
3. Combined line loads (HULL/MULL/LULL) affect overall cooling efficiency
4. Ambient temperature amplifies load's impact on OT during summer

[Domain Knowledge]
* Transformer temperature is function of: load + ambient temp + cooling efficiency
* High voltage loads typically contribute more to temperature rise
* Line loads reflect total load, phase loads reflect imbalance
* Thermal inertia causes cumulative time-delayed effects
* Historical load patterns better predict OT than instantaneous values
